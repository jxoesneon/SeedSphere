# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

- 1.x: security updates are applied to the latest minor release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Please report security vulnerabilities via GitHub Security Advisories (private report):
  - Repository → Security → Advisories → Report a vulnerability
- If you cannot use advisories, open a private issue and mark it clearly as security-related.
- Provide as much detail as possible:
  - Affected versions and components (paths, files, endpoints)
  - Reproduction steps or proof-of-concept
  - Impact assessment (confidentiality/integrity/availability)
  - Suggested fixes or mitigations if known

We aim to acknowledge reports within 3 business days and provide an initial assessment or timeline within 7 business days.

## Scope notes

- Do not test or attack infrastructure you do not own.
- Avoid data exfiltration; proof-of-concept with minimal impact is preferred.
- Respect rate limits and legal boundaries.
